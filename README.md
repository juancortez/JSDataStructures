# JavaScript

This repository contains code that is all written in JavaScript to solve Data Structure, or Common Interview Problems.

All of the files can be run independently, so to run Graph.js for example, run $node Graph.js and it will execute the code. Some files have a DEBUG variable set to false for testing. To enable the tests, set DEBUG to true and re-run the file.
